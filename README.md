# worldwallet
Financial tracker that connects your global bank accounts and displays your finances in real time.

## Idea
I've had the opportunity to live in 5 countries during my life, and I've opened bank accounts in each of these countries. Keeping track of my finances in one country is already difficult, but keeping track of my global finances has been a true challenge.

For years I looked for solutions to manage my finances, but most apps have these problems: access to financial information from only one country, restricted to one currency, complex UI and being subscription-based.

worldwallet is my attempt to make global financial tracking accessible to everyone. In a simple and elegant app.

This is what sets worldwallet apart:
* âœ¨ clean and intuitive interface
* ðŸŒŽ global access to financial data
* ðŸ’¸ live currency conversion

## Description
![Screenshot of worldwallet's dashboard showing mock financial data](./client/assets/dashboard-image.png)

worldwallet is a networth tracker for the global nomad. It connects to your bank accounts in different countries, and shows your combined balances and liabilities.

The dashboard shows all your global balances and liabilities in separate lists. You are also able to see your total networth.

The app uses Plaid (a security-first API service that authenticates financial information) to retrieve and update the financial data displayed on the dashboard.

Supported countries: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Unites States, ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spain and the ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ United Kingdom.

Note: 
1) to connect to your real bank accounts' balances and liablilites data, you MUST pay for the Plaid API.
2) not all countries offer access to balances and liablities data, check Plaid's website for more information: https://plaid.com/en-gb/global/
3) in the app, only the US bank accounts offer LIABILITY information. But US, Spain, and UK bank accounts offer BALANCES data.
